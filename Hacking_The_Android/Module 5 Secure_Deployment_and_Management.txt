What is MDM?
    Mobile Device Management (MDM) refers to software solutions that enable organizations to monitor, manage, and secure mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, within a corporate environment. MDM allows IT administrators to enforce security policies, manage applications, and ensure compliance with organizational standards. Key functionalities include device enrollment, remote wiping of lost or stolen devices, application management, and monitoring device health and usage.
